    "Functions are advantageous to have in programs for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "Code organization and modularity: Functions allow you to break down your program into smaller, self-contained units of code. Each function can perform a specific task or operation, making your code more organized and easier to understand. By dividing your program into functions, you can also reuse code and avoid repetition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Code reusability: Functions can be reused in different parts of a program or even in other programs. Once you define a function, you can call it multiple times without having to rewrite the same code. This promotes code efficiency, reduces redundancy, and simplifies maintenance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction and encapsulation: Functions provide a level of abstraction by hiding the implementation details of a particular task or operation. Other parts of the program can use the function without needing to know how it works internally. This promotes code encapsulation, making it easier to manage and maintain complex programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Readability and comprehension: Functions enhance code readability by giving meaningful names to blocks of code that perform specific operations. Well-named functions can make your program's logic more understandable and make it easier for other developers to collaborate on the codebase.\n",
    "\n",
    "Testing and debugging: Functions can be individually tested and debugged, which simplifies the process of identifying and fixing issues in your code. By isolating specific functionality within functions, you can focus your debugging efforts on smaller units of code, making it easier to identify and resolve errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Code efficiency: Functions can improve code efficiency by promoting modular design and reducing duplication. Instead of repeating the same code in multiple places, you can encapsulate it within a function and call that function whenever needed. This not only saves development time but also reduces the overall size of your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, functions provide a structured approach to programming, enabling code reuse, enhancing readability, promoting modularity, and facilitating maintenance and collaboration.\n",

    "Function: A function is a named block of reusable code that performs a specific task or operation. It is a self-contained unit that can accept input parameters (if any) and may produce a result or have side effects when executed. Functions are defined using a specific syntax and can be called from different parts of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Function Call: A function call, also known as invoking or executing a function, is the act of using a function in a program at a specific point to perform its defined task. When a function is called, the program transfers control to that function, executes its code, and then returns control to the point immediately after the function call. Function calls typically include passing arguments (input values) if the function requires them."
